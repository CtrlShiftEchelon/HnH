# Haven & Hearth Efficiency
*An Excel-driven analysis of Haven & Hearth item mechanics designed to help players optimize early progression after world resets. This project models quality spiraling, crafting recursion, and item dependencies to identify the most efficient leveling routes.*

This project provides data-driven insights into the crafting and leveling systems of Haven & Hearth, focusing on recursive quality improvements (“spiraling”) of items. It offers tools and spreadsheets for players to optimize their crafting routes, especially during the semi-annual world wipes.

Features:

    Excel spreadsheets detailing item dependencies and quality calculations
    
    Power Query scripts automating data transformations
    
    Visualizations of optimal crafting paths and quality spirals
    
    Instructions for updating data post-wipe
